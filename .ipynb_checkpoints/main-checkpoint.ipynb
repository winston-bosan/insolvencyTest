It is a public entity listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the ticker symbol “CHOO”. As of the CCAA filing date, Choom operated 17 retail locations in Canada - two in British Columbia, twelve in Alberta and three in Ontario. Cannabis retail operations in Canada have endured a challenging business climate as a result of the industry being in its infancy and there being an oversaturation of cannabis retail operations in certain markets, particularly Alberta. Additionally, Choom has been negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail store closures, physical distancing requirements and lower retail “foot traffic” resulted in lower sales than otherwise anticipated. EY was appointed monitor.

      "<p>0989705 B.C. Ltd., Alderbridge Way GP Ltd., and Alderbridge Way Limited Partnership, Richmond, British Columbia-based real estate development companies, were granted CCAA protection on April 1. The companies have spent several years developing a high-density, mixed-used construction project, which will comprise seven mid-rise towers atop a multi-level podium with three levels of underground parking. In March 2020, citing the effects of COVID-19 and the economic outlook, Romspen Investment Corporation, the companies’ senior secured construction lender, suspended all further draws and advances under the companies’ construction facility. The companies spent the next year seeking alternative construction financing, economic concessions from project proponents, and additional injections of equity, while securing several further advances from the companies’ second-lien lenders (the \"2ML Lenders\"). However, the companies were unable to secure the considerable replacement construction financing that the development required. Currently, the companies have completed the major pre-construction phases of the development, pre-sold a significant portion of the development and largely finished the major undertaking of site excavation and off-site civil work. They have worked with their 2ML Lenders on a restructuring transaction to be effected by way of a credit bid that would, among other things, see Romspen and any other priority claims paid and a significant portion of the 2ML Lenders’ debt converted to equity and, concurrently with the development of a credit bid, a sale and investment solicitation process run with the assistance of a monitor with enhanced powers. A&amp;M was appointed monitor.

At the time, the company was subject to CCAA proceedings, having sought protection after the company's former CEO and others were discovered to have allegedly committed embezzlement and fraud in connection with the company's assets. Pandion brought a receivership application, arguing that, among other things, the CCAA proceedings were eroding Pandion's collateral. The company opposed, arguing that, among other things, Pandion had not delivered notice under s. 244 of the BIA and that, as a consequence, was only entitled to the appointment of an interim receiver under s. 47 of the BIA. The company also argued that the amount of Pandion's debt was not as claimed. The Court granted the interim receivership order, which is to remain in force until the release of the reasons for decision on the receivership application. Deloitte was appointed interim receiver.

The companies’ largest creditor is Pandion Mine Finance, which has advanced a total principal amount of $32,600,000 USD to the companies between 2017 and 2020. As at December 7, 2021 (when the loan is due), the amount owing to Pandion inclusive of principal and interest will be $25,875,000 USD. Until November 2021, the companies were managed by Lionsbridge Capital Pty Ltd., and the majority of Otso's directors and officers were Lionsbridge nominees. As a result of various concerns relating to Lionsbridge's management, A&amp;M was appointed to provide restructuring services to the companies on November 24. Shortly thereafter, Lionsbridge's principals resigned and purported to terminate the management agreement. The companies also discovered that, among other things, Lionsbridge's office at the Otso Gold Mine had been completely emptied and Otso's computers and files had been removed; there were unaccounted for charges on Otso's credit card; and one of the companies had sold approximately $740,000 of gold which was paid for by wire transfer, but the funds are allegedly missing from Otso's bank accounts. Based on the above, an Otso executive made contact with Finnish border control services to report possible criminal activity, and, according to the company, Finnish authorities have apprehended one of the principals and placed him into custody. Deloitte was appointed monitor. Counsel is Farris for the companies, BLG for the monitor and Cassels for Pandion.</p>\n",
